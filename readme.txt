I have created this simple plugin because of the user request, You can use this vertical marquee plugin to make your text scroll upward or downwards. This plugin will work all leading browsers except old Netscape browsers. In this plugin i used simple HTML marquee tag to scroll the plugin and it loads very fast, and it is pure HTML so no java script required. admin option available to change the text style and marquee speed.
